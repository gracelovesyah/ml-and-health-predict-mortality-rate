## Machine Learning-Based Mortality Prediction in ICU Patients with Acute Kidney Injury: A Retrospective Analysis Using the MIMIC-IV Database
This is an on-going project for COMP90089. This repo will include the working codes and research proposal illustrating our overall approach and research goal. 

The dataset located at `/data/df_final.csv` is utilised for crafting our machine learning model. In this dataset, the `dod` column signifies the mortality rate, which is our primary target for prediction. Meanwhile, `subject_id` denotes the unique identifier for each patient. All other columns represent crucial clinical, lab, and demographic attributes that can serve as predictor variables.
